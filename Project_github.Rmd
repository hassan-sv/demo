## About case study 

This case study explores the usage patterns of Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, to understand how casual riders and annual members differ in their bike usage. The goal is to provide actionable insights to convert casual riders into annual members, ultimately driving the company’s growth
This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on [link](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics)

## Step 1: Ask
Company Background

Cyclistic launched its bike-share program in 2016, offering over 5,800 bikes and 600 docking stations across Chicago. The company stands out by providing inclusive options like reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, catering to riders with disabilities or those who cannot use standard two-wheeled bikes.

Cyclistic offers three pricing plans:

Single-ride passes
Full-day passes
Annual memberships

Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are classified as casual riders, while those with annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

## Scenario

The marketing team, led by Lily Moreno, aims to convert casual riders into annual members to ensure the company’s future success. To achieve this, the team needs to:

Understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
Develop data-driven marketing strategies to persuade casual riders to become members.

## Key Questions

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
What insights can guide the design of a new marketing strategy?

## Stakeholders

Lily Moreno: Director of Marketing
Cyclistic Executive Team   
Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team
    
## Step 2 : Prepare 
The dataset includes 12 months of bike-share data for 2024, sourced from Divvy Trip Data. The data is organized in CSV files, with each file representing one month of activity.
Tools Used

Excel: For initial data inspection and validation & Query
RStudio: For data cleaning, analysis and visualization
Tableau : For data visualization 
    
## Data Cleaning Process

  Installed necessary R packages (tidyverse, skimr, janitor, ggplot2, lubridate, etc.).

  Imported and merged 12 monthly CSV files into a single data frame.

  Checked for duplicates, missing values, and inconsistencies.

  Added new columns using excel 

  duration_trip: Calculated ride duration (ended_at - started_at).

  day : Extracted the day of the week from started_at.

  Saved the cleaned data as a new CSV file for analysis.
    
```{r install packages }
#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("skimr")
#install.packages("janitor")
#install.packages('ggplot2')
#install.packages("hms")
#install.packages("lubridate")
#install.packages("hms")
```

## Step 3: Process
Data Cleaning Highlights

  Merged Data: Combined 12 monthly datasets into one dataframe with over 5 million rows.
  Duplicates: No duplicates were found.
  Blank Columns : Many columns had blanks and nulls which were deleted 
  Negative Durations: Identified and excluded rides with negative durations (likely due to   data entry errors).
  New Columns: Added duration_hours and day for further analysis
  combining all the months to a single data frame df_2024
## Loading library

```{r load packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(hms)
library(readr)

```
### Importing all the cleaned dataframes which are formated as CSV 

```{r loading all files}
jan_df <- read.csv("C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/df_jan.csv")
mar_df <- read.csv("C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/df_mar.csv")
feb_df <- read.csv("C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/df_feb.csv")
apr_df <- read.csv("C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/df_apr.csv")
may_df <- read.csv("C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/df_maj.csv")
jun_df <- read.csv("C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/df_jun.csv")
jul_df <- read.csv("C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/df_juli.csv")
aug_df <- read.csv("C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/df_aug.csv")
sep_df <- read.csv("C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/df_sep.csv")
oct_df <- read.csv("C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/df_okt.csv")
nov_df <- read.csv("C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/df_nov.csv")
dec_df <- read.csv("C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/df_dec.csv")
```


## Combine all the dataframes into one 

```{r combining all data frames}
df_2024 <- bind_rows(jan_df,feb_df,mar_df,apr_df,may_df,jun_df,jul_df,aug_df,sep_df,oct_df,nov_df,dec_df)
glimpse(df_2024)
```
```{r check if merge worked}
head(df_2024)
```

```{r check number of rows & Columns after merge}
dim(df_2024)
```

```{r Check for Duplicates - There are no Duplicates}
sum(duplicated(df_2024))
```
## Step 4: Analyze
#### Key Insights

Ride Duration:

Average ride duration: ~11 minutes.
Longest ride: 23 hours 46 minutes.
Shortest ride: 0.039 seconds (likely a data error).
  
#### Popular Days:
  
Saturday had the highest number of rides, followed by Wednesday.
Monday was the least popular day.

#### Bike Types:

Only electric bikes, electric scooters, and classic bikes were used in 2024.
None of the inclusive bike options (e.g., reclining bikes, hand tricycles) were rented.

#### Rider Types:

Casual riders accounted for over 2 million rides.
Members used bikes more frequently on weekdays eg wednesday, while casual riders          dominated weekends.

Offer discounts or promotions to encourage riders to try these options.

Target Casual Riders:

Introduce flexible membership plans (e.g., monthly subscriptions) to attract casual riders.

Offer incentives, such as discounted annual memberships or bonus ride credits.

Weekend Promotions:

Launch weekend-specific promotions for casual riders at popular stations.

Highlight the benefits of membership, such as cost savings and convenience.
